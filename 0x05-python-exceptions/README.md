## Description

This folder contains assignements about exception handling.

Generally, in python, there are two types of errors - namely
syntax errors and exception errors. Syntax errors are errors
that occur as a result of programmatic syntax errors. For instance
when using a method in a functon that python does not recognize.
Exceptions on the other hand, involves errors that happen when the 
code is already running but encounters and hits some constraints
agains the use of some functions or operations.

For instance there is an exception error called `IndexError` that will
be outputted to the screen in the case of trying to index a list beyond its
existent indices. There are a lot of Builtin Exceptions in Python, which
can be caught and operated with.

In the course of this tasks, we will be mainly dealing with the following
keywords `try`, `except`, `finally`, `raise`, `else` coupled with the try
except statement blocks. And other functions and keywords.

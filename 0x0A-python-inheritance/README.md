### This directory contains files that experiments on Python' Inheritance

One of the most important concept in a typical OOP like python is the concept
of Inheritance. And inheritance is important for the following reasons:

1. It easily represents real life interaction.
2. It is transitive, which means that we can have child classes of parent classes,
and grandchild classes that inherit properties of the parent class.
3. Code reusability: You can easily reuse codes, and even and add more functions,
without modifying the original code.
4. Easy to model and understand codes.
5. Easy code development and maintenance.

There are a couple of interesting python keywords that are used in the subject 
of `inheritance` such as super(), isinstance, issubclass, e.t.c.

SHALL WE?
